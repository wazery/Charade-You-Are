Since a good period of time, I became an emotionless person. My view to the world has been changed a lot. Actually I see all of these eyes the same way. Bold, empty, and worthless. I don't care for anyone, I see people who suffer, along with people who laugh, everyday, actually both are the same. I don't know what is changed, but I just feel nothing even to those I have known years and years!

I must admit that if I lost anyone I will just raise my middle finger, saying FUCK YOU! And fuck you life!

Hate, love, intimacy, friendship, fear, caring, all these words has nothing to do with me. Being like a robot, a bare metal one that works the way it's supposed to, is the most relevant thing to be in this world. You will just let everything go, and fight for your success. Only you in this world who deserves, actualy not you, me!
