Did you ever eat something and didn't feel its taste? I swear I did. I don't know when that is started, but I realized that I can eat anything and all of the things I do eat has no taste. Also their is no smell for anything, I don't know what actually is going on, but that is very good, I am sure. 

Yesterdat I tried something, I got a knife, a big one. I wounded my self in my leg, like getting a cross section in it, but not that much. My goal is to get some blood.

I got an enough amount of it, then I tasted it, that is the only thing I really felt its taste.

Then I tried to make myself feel agian, I didn't feel the wound, so I got a nail clipper, and completly removed my leg's small finger nail, also I didn't feel it. 

I can say all of this is good, I hope that lasts for my entire life, I hope to not feel anything again.
